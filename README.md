# HTLN-BreedingBird-DRR

Developing first data release report for HTLN. The working example is breeding
birds. The plan is to create R scripts that will serve as external QA/QC
tests of the breeding bird data set. The final dataset will be published 
on NPS IRMA Datastore.

Created a 'stub' reference for DRR in DataStore here:

Plan to develop some QA-QC R code to validate
the .csv files in the data package. These will be stored here
along with the DRR.
